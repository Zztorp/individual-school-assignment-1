# individual-school-assignment-1

My first individual school assignment.
In this assignment I'll focus a lot on HTML and some CSS. 
There should be some Javascript included but that's not the main thing here. 
I want to learn how to use semantic HTML and to also structure HTML in the best way so I can link it with the CSS nice and logical and awesome.

I love structuring it in classes to be able to go in and style a specific element in the code. 
I want to do it the "right" way so it follows a good logicpattern.
I've noticed that if you do not have a good HTML-foundation, CSS can become a living hell to style. ლ(ಠ益ಠლ)

Hope you enjoy!
